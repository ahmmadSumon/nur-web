Lack of financial means and local capacity to collect the waste and build sewerages have turned urban centers into difficult places to live. Many locals and policymakers are worrying about the aforementioned problems and particularly the operational areas of our organization, the BES. In general, saving the remaining environment, if any, and restoring its natural beauty is an issue that BES is seeking. BES feels this question is complex and requires the solidarity of collective actors with different perspectives and opinions on dealing with the environmental issue in Somalia in general, particularly the operational areas.</p>
